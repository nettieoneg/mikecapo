<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
<p>My name is Mike Capobianco. I work as a Quality Engineer in the manufacturing industry. My job consists mainly of
problem solving and putting out proverbial fires.</p> 
<p>I am married and have 2 children. We also have 4 cats at home. My children are boy-girl twins and are almost 3 
years old.</p>

<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
<p>I earned my Bachelors Degree from the State University of New York and my Masters Degree from Long Island University.</p>
<p>I have worked as an Energy Engineer in the past. My job consisted of evaluating homes and businesses for solar capability
and then designing solar arrays for them.</p>

<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
<p>I enjoy the outdoors very much. I like to hike, especially along waterways and in densly forested areas.</p>
<p>I also enjoy to read. I have a goal of reading a book, from cover to cover, at least once every three months.</p>
